Use the g@ operator or the :Figlet command to filter your text through figlet, in-place!
:Figlet has a completion function that will complete on installed font names, too.

Plus, there is a Windows/MS-DOS version of Figlet, so everybody can get in on the fun!

Q: Can't I do this same thing with the :! command?
A: Basically, sure

Q: What does this plugin give me that Vim's built-in filtering doesn't?
A1. Convenience - through variables it can remember your defaults
A2. Completion - so you don't have to memorize all of the commands or font names
A3. Text-objects - use the g@ operator with text-objects for blazing fast transformations that will knock shoulder-surfer's socks off
A4. A font sample buffer to help you pick out the perfect font for the occasion

Q: Okay, I'm sold.  But what is this Figlet you speak of?
A: This:
  __ _       _      _   
 / _(_) __ _| | ___| |_ 
| |_| |/ _` | |/ _ \ __|
|  _| | (_| | |  __/ |_ 
|_| |_|\__, |_|\___|\__|
       |___/            

Er, that wasn't quite as impressive as I was hoping.  Check out http://www.figlet.org/ to get with the times.
